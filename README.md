# The official repository for the Rock the JVM Akka Streams with Scala course

This repository contains the code we wrote during  [Rock the JVM's Akka Streams with Scala](https://rockthejvm.com/course/akka-streams) course. Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

### How to install
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project

No need to do anything else, as the IDE will take care to download and apply the appropriate library dependencies.

### How to start

Checkout the start tag:

```
git checkout start
```

and open the project in IntelliJ as usual.

### How to run an intermediate state

The repository was built while recording the lectures. Prior to each lecture, I tagged each commit so you can easily go back to an earlier state of the repo!

The tags are as follows:

* `start`
* `1.1-scala-recap`
* `1.2-akka-recap`
* `2.1-first-principles`
* `2.2-materializing-streams`
* `2.3-operator-fusion`
* `2.4-backpressure`
* `3.1-graphs`
* `3.2-open-graphs`
* `3.3-more-open-graphs`
* `3.4-graph-materialized-values`
* `3.5-bidiflows`
* `3.6-graph-cycles`
* `4.1-integrating-with-actors`
* `4.2-integrating-with-external-services`
* `4.3-advanced-backpressure`
* `4.4-fault-tolerance`
* `4.5-testing-streams`
* `5.1-dynamic-stream-handling`
* `5.2-substreams`
* `5.3-custom-graph-shapes`
* `5.4-graphstage`
* `5.5-graphstage-part-2`

When you watch a lecture, you can `git checkout` the appropriate tag and the repo will go back to the exact code I had when I started the lecture.
